Boards Revamp Project
=================
My journey into JavaScript began in 2016, by creating relatively simple dynamic and styled posts on the League of Legends Boards. Over the next few years, my time within the League of Legends community and with the Riot Games Volunteer Program allowed me an opportunity to spaghetti code my way into self-studying jQuery, Vanilla JavaScript, and then a workable understanding of ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, and a number of other neat technologies.\
\
The purpose of this repo isn't to show off the most efficient or attractive code (I can tell you that you won't find that here); instead, hopefully this repo will show you a small part of my early exploration into what were then new and foreign concepts to me, and more importantly the fostering of a long-lasting passion of JavaScript and web development.

## And for posterity, some of the crazy things & milestones that led up to this point:
* **[Jan 2015]** joining the NA-RG Volunteer Program as a Help & Support "Wrenchman"
* **[Jan 2016]** working with the Riot Games Oceania office, especially m'boy Woody 'Maraudaur' Wu to kickstart their community volunteer program
* **[Oct 2017]** unintentionally discovering a XSS vulnerability in the Boards platform's backend that allowed us to initially roll out the Boards' first frontend updates in years
* the Live Services team (unsurprisingly) reaching out the next day with great concern and alarm
* **[Nov 2017]** connecting with Riot's Apollo Team to begin rolling out updates on both the NA and OCE Boards platforms
* **[Onwards]** working with different teams and individuals across North America, Oceania, Europe, Latin America, Turkey, Japan, Russia

On March 9, 2020, Riot Games ended their support for the League of Legends Community Platform. It has been a hell of a ride, and I'll forever be grateful for all of the Rioters, volunteers, and community members who have been a pivotal part of my experience and journey within the League of Legends community and into web programming.
